This a simple content based filter model.
It takes the csv file provided that contains 1000 movies scraped from IMDB and 
puts it into a dataframe with Pandas. It proceeds to split the data between text data 
and the other columns which are Genre, Overview, Series_Title. It uses SentenceTransformer 
to make the model that takes the text data and places them in a dense vector space for clustering.
This is followed up by cosine similarity to finally create a dataframe that holds the recommended 
movies for each title. The program asks the user for a movie and the recommendation systems searches 
by partial or full title name while ignoring case sensitive letters. The program proceeds to find the film 
and print the top 5 recommended films. The user can also ask to print the plots and genres for each film.
